# **Beyond Social Media Marketing – Project Brief**

**Beyond Social Media Marketing** is an AI-powered platform that enables businesses to create, optimize, schedule, and publish high-performing social media videos with minimal effort. The platform is designed to remove the complexity of content creation by combining AI scripting, video generation, editing, analytics, and automated posting into one seamless workflow.

Users subscribe to a monthly plan that includes a fixed number of videos per month. Each plan has a maximum video allowance (for example, 10 videos per month). Once the limit is reached, users can either upgrade their plan or purchase additional videos individually. Payments are handled through Stripe, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Upon purchase, users receive login credentials to access their admin dashboard.

The admin panel provides a clear overview of total videos created, remaining videos for the billing cycle, total engagement, total reach, and all scheduled posts. A prominent “Create New Video” button is always visible to encourage frequent content creation. Users can also view upcoming and published content through an in-app calendar.

When creating a video, users first select their industry (such as property, engineering, or food and beverage) and the type of video they want to create—whether fully AI-generated, built from uploaded images, remixed from existing videos, or created from scratch. Since many users may not know how to write effective AI prompts, the platform provides guided prompt formats optimized for each industry, using structured prompting logic behind the scenes.

The AI analyzes performance data scraped from social media platforms to recommend the best-performing video formats, hooks, and content styles for each industry. It then refines the script for maximum engagement and retention before passing it to the video generation engine. Users can upload their own images or pre-recorded videos—such as property walkthroughs—which the AI integrates into the final video with dialogue, text, and transitions.

Users may optionally upload a short voice sample, allowing the AI to replicate their voice for narration, making the videos more realistic and personalized. After generation, videos can be edited in an in-app editor similar to CapCut, where users can adjust scenes, apply AI-recommended music, add auto-generated subtitles, and fine-tune the final output.

The platform automatically generates optimized captions, hashtags, and calls-to-action tailored to each social media platform to maximize reach and engagement. Videos are then scheduled and posted to TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Posting times initially rely on industry-wide performance data and are continuously refined based on each user’s engagement metrics. Content is intelligently spread throughout the week and published at the most effective times.

Users can track all scheduled and published content through a visual calendar and monitor performance through built-in analytics. Over time, the system learns from user-specific data to further optimize video formats, scripts, and posting schedules.
